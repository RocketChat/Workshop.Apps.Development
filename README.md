# Workshop.Apps.Development
Guide to get started with Rocket.Chat Apps Development Workshop.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Node.js v20.18.1
- Unix-based OS (Linux, macOS, WSL2)

### Part 1: Deploying Your First Rocket.Chat App
In this part, you'll learn how to deploy a summarization app and implement a slash command.

#### 1. Install the Rocket.Chat Apps CLI
Install `rc-apps` globally:

```bash
npm install -g @rocket.chat/apps-cli
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
rc-apps -v
```

You should see the CLI version information:

```bash
@rocket.chat/apps-cli/1.12.0 darwin-arm64 node-v20.18.1
```

> **Note:** The platform information (e.g., "darwin-arm64") will differ depending on your operating system.

#### 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RocketChat/Apps.Chat.Summarize.git
```

#### 3. Navigate to the app directory

```bash
cd Apps.Chat.Summarize/app 
```

#### 4. Personalize your app
Modify the following files:

- In the `app.json` file:
  - Change `nameSlug` to a unique value (e.g., `ai-chat-summarizer-<yourname>`)
  - Generate a new UUID at [uuidgenerator.net](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4) for the `id` field
    - **Important:** Do NOT use `0034268f-e49a-4113-be51-4a5ca77aeeb1`
  - Update the `author` field with your name

- Replace the `icon.png` file:
  1. Delete the existing icon
  2. Create a new icon (recommend using AI image generation)
  3. You can use [Pollinations.AI](https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/YOUR_INITIAL_avatar) with your initial
  4. Save as `icon.png` (keep file size small)

#### 5. Customize your command
Open `/commands/SummarizeCommand.ts` and change the `command` field to a unique name (e.g., `<yourname>-chat-summary`).

#### 6. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### 7. Build your app

```bash
rc-apps package
```

#### 8. Configure and deploy
Edit the `.rcappsconfig` file with your credentials:

```json
{
  "url": "https://workspace_server_url",
  "username": "your_username",
  "password": "your_password"
}
```

> **Important:** Use the server URL shared in the workshop room along with your personal credentials.

Deploy your app:

```bash
rc-apps deploy
```

#### 9. Update the LLM API endpoint
Modify the API call from `http://llama3-8b` to `http://llama3-8b:1234`

> **Hint:** Look for the `llama3-8b` settings key in the `setting.ts` file and update it to `llama3-8b:1234`

> **Note:** The API call is made to `http://llama3-8b:1234/v1/chat/completions` so `llama3-8b` is the hostname and `1234` the port.

#### 10. Test your slash command
Type `/<yourname>-chat-summary` in any Rocket.Chat channel and press Enter.

### Part 2: Enabling Add-ons

1. Navigate to **Administration** (kebab menu) â†’ **Marketplace**
2. Select the **Private Apps** tab
3. Find and click on your deployed app
4. Go to the **Settings** tab
5. In the **Summary add-ons** section, select any one add-on
6. Click **Save**
7. Test your command again with `/<yourname>-chat-summary`
8. Verify that you see the chat summary plus the selected add-on functionality
9. Take a screenshot of your successful result
10. Share your screenshot in the workshop channel along with your email address to receive an invitation to the Workshop Meetup
